AI: Hello there! You seem to be going through something health-wise, could you tell me more about it?

Human: Hi, well you now I'm always kinda feeling like if I stand after sitting for long or if I wake up from bed my heart just goes crazy. it's like it would jump out from my chest

AI: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing that. It must be quite unsettling. Could you perhaps describe a bit more about how this affects your daily routine or activities?

Human: it's damn hard you know, always kinda dizzy and tire all day. when i stand to do sth it worsens and on top I almost feel like I'm 'bout to black out 

AI: That sounds quite difficult. Does anything seem to help when you're going through this? Have you found any exercise, rest, or perhaps certain positions that lessen the symptoms?

Human: yeah, it's a bit of a Hell. i've noticed that if i am not up and moving around too much its bit better also If i lay down that helps too, kinda like gravity is kicking my ass haha

AI: It's great you're able to find a bit of humor in this. With these experiences, have you also noticed changes in your emotions or mentality that you think might be associated with these physical sensations?

Human: well honestly i'm never certain how I'm gonna feel in the next moment. it's scary and yeah makes me kinda anxious and edgy... it's in my head always, "what if I faint next", you get me?

AI: I can understand how that uncertainty would be anxiety-inducing. However, you're not alone in this. While I may not be able to diagnose, I'm here to empathize and help you navigate through your experience. From your descriptions, it seems these episodes particularly involve standing or transitioning from laying down to standing. This might be something you could bring up with your doctor. It could be significant in figuring out what's happening.
