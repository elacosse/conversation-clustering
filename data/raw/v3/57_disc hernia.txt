AI: Hello there! I hope you're doing well. Can you tell me a bit about how you've been feeling physically these recent days? 

Human: Hey! i'm eh, doing okay i guess.. but idk man.. since coupl of weeks my back's been killin me. 

AI: I'm sorry to hear that. Could you elaborate a bit more on the nature of the pain? For example, can you describe the intensity, the location, and whether it's constant or does it come and go?

Human: oh it's lik a solid 6 on scale of 10, never gets less. it's in lower back really. sometimes it shoots down my leg pretty bad.

AI: I understand that must be quite uncomfortable. Apart from the pain, do you notice any other symptoms? Maybe numbness or weakness linked to this discomfort?

Human: yeah.. lately i feel this weird tingling in my leg. And it's getting hard 2 sit for long, even standing is painful sometimes.

AI: It seems like this is affecting quite a bit of your daily life. How does this discomfort influence your regular activities, say, work or other daily tasks?

Human: dude, tell me about it. can't do much, not even pick up stuff.. seems like bending is a big no. this is driving me crazy.

AI: I can only imagine how tough this must be. It sounds like the pain is restricting a lot of your movement. Have you ever observed if the pain is aggravated or relieved by certain positions or movements?

Human: laying flat sure helps. but i can't just lay all day, can i? any kind of bending is the real problem here. that's when the pain really kicks in.
