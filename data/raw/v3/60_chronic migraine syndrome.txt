AI: Hello! Thanks for taking the time to chat with me today. Can you begin by sharing how you've been feeling lately? 

Human: HI, thanks 4 asking. I been having this weird sensation, like my head, it just hurts really bad now n then. It kinda just keeps coming back, u know? Not sure wat's goin on. 

AI: I'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling well. When you say your head hurts really bad, can you elaborate a bit more? Are there any specific locations in your head where the pain seems to focus? 

Human: Yeah mostly here, like behind my eyes an also on one side of my head. They get so strong, I can barely do anything that time. An lights, loud noise, they just seems too much, they makes it even severe.

AI: That sounds tough, I can imagine that's quite disruptive to your day-to-day activities. Do you notice if there are times when these sensations are more severe than others? Are there things that make it better or worse? 

Human: well yea, stress def makes its worse, and sometimes weather change to... dont know why. An i notice it gets better when i lay down in a dark room, away frm noise.

AI: It seems you have found some ways to alleviate the discomfort. How frequently are these instances occurring to you? And when it happens, for how long does the pain usually last? 

Human: Its unpredictable, some weeks it occurs 3, maybe 4 times. When it happens, it can last for hours, sometimes whole day even...

AI: It must be really challenging dealing with the unpredictable nature of the pain. How does this impact your daily tasks or activities? You've mentioned it gets severe at times, so I imagine this could be quite disruptive. 

Human: Ur right, it effectes evrything. my work, I have 2 take sick leaves often, cant even focus properly. nd even tough to spend time with family, or go out with friends... mostly jst in bed.

AI: It sounds like these painful episodes are really impacting your quality of life. How do you cope with this? What helps you stay positive and continue doing the things you love?

Human: Its hard, but I guess you kinda just learn to live with it. I try to relax, practice deep breathing when it happens. That helps sometimes... But just wish I could go back to normal, u know?
