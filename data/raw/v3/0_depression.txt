AI: Hi there! I'm doing a research project and I'm interested in hearing from people about how they're feeling these days. How have you been doing lately?

Human: hi, well not so great actually. i've kinda been struggleing a bit.

AI: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you describe what you're feeling or going through? It might help to talk about it.

Human: Oh idk....its been tough... I kinda always feel sad and low. You know like a kinda persistent feeling that just doesn't go away...

AI: That must be tough, feeling like you're under a cloud that doesn't lift. When did you start feeling this way?

Human: Yeah thats pretty accurate.. Umm maybe a year ago? but its got really bad lately

AI: Not an easy thing to deal with, especially over such a long time. Can you tell me more about the "really bad" part? What's been happening?

Human: It's like I'm losing interest in things I used to like, I even stopped calling my frnds and just sit around doing nothing. I don't know, i just dont feel like doing anything.

AI: That sounds really challenging. It must be hard feeling detached from things and people you used to enjoy. Do these feelings affect your sleeping or eating patterns?

Human: Yeah definitely. i can't sleep properly at nights & my appetite is a mess.. i barely eat.

AI: It sounds like this is having a significant impact on your day-to-day life. Has there been anything that you've found, no matter how small, that gives you a bit of a break from these feelings?

Human: Not much really... I guess sometimes music helps a little... but it's not a cure or anything

AI: Music can be a form of solace. I'm glad to hear it gives you a bit of relief, even though it's not a solution. How does this ongoing situation affect your thoughts about the future?

Human: tbh i dont even think i have a future at this point... I can hardly plan a day in advance let alone think about the future...

AI: That sounds tough â€“ dealing with the daily struggle and feeling unable to see past it. I see how hard this is for you. It's really brave of you to share all of this with me.
