Human: its like im fine 1 minut, then suddenly felling faint and heart racing. Woops standing up 2 quick again

AI: That sounds incredibly unpleasant! I'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. Could you please describe what happens during these episodes—maybe the sequence of events, feelings, or any warning signs before these symptoms appear?

Human: ya okay. its like i get up and suddenly, everything is spinning... feeling dizzy, my heart starts racing super fast. Sometime I just have 2 sit down or lie. Happens mostly when I get up from bed or chair. 

AI: Thanks for sharing that. I can see why this would be disruptive and scary for you. On a scale from 1-10, how severe would you rate the dizziness and the racing heart? Also, do you experience any other sensations or changes during these episodes? Maybe in your breathing or vision?

Human: prob like at 8. it hits me hard. Breathing becomes difficult like m running a marathon. vision gets blurry at times too. it’s messes up normal stuff for me

AI: It does sound very intense. I'm sorry you have to deal with this level of discomfort. Can you share a bit about how this has impacted your daily life or activities? 

Human: somedays I just can’t go out coz im scared of having another episode. wasn't like this before. had 2 quit my job because of this. it sucks, but what can i do... 

AI: I appreciate how distressing this must be for you, and you're so brave for coping with something this challenging. Has there been any circumstances that help alleviate these symptoms, perhaps certain actions, or rest?

Human: lying down helps most of the time, takes time but heart calms down and dizzy thing goes away. some deep slow breath also seems 2 help
