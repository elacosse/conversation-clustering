AI: Hello! Hope you're having a decent day. I was hoping to connect with you and understand some things about your everyday experience. Can you start by sharing some things that might happen on a typical day for you?

Human: Hey there... Well some days r okish, but others... Life's been feelin like I'm on a carousal ride most days, only I never got on willingly, u know?

AI: I see, that sounds challenging. Can you describe that carousel feeling a bit more? Is it about unexpected turns, ups, and downs?

Human: It's like...i stand up and the world starts spinning, everything blurs for a bit. Then my heart starts racing like crazy race car. I feel light headed most times 

AI: Oh no, that does sound intense. I'm sorry to hear you're going through that. How frequently do you experience these episodes?

Human: Its tricky, cuz it's not always the same. Sum days it happens a few time, sum days not that much. But pretty much every time I get up after sitting for a while, stuff gets woozy.

AI: I imagine it must be disorienting and quite uncomfortable. Besides the dizziness and the racing heartbeat, are there any other feelings or physical symptoms accompanying these episodes?

Human: Yeah...lot of times, my legs start tremblin and sometimes feel weak, like I've just run a marathon. Funny thing, sometimes I get all hot n sweaty out of nowhere... I thought I was just stressed u know, but dunno anymore

AI: It certainly sounds complicating. Are these experiences affecting your day-to-day activities or lifestyle in any specific way?

Human: Yeh, kinda sucks big time. I have to be super careful not to stand too fast. Sometimes have to sit down on the floor out of nowhere. People look at me like I'm some kinda weirdo, makes it hard to make plans or go out.

AI: That must be frustrating and exhausting, to have to constantly pre-empt these episodes and alter your life around them. How do you cope with these feelings of being perceived differently by the people around you?

Human: It's hard, really. Sumtimes I just avoid people altogether, cuz explaining it each time gets tiring. I've tried meditation, helps a bit. But still worry what people think...
