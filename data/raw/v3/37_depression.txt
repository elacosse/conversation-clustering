AI: Hey there! I noticed that you've not been yourself lately. Would you like to talk about what's been going on?

Human: Hey. Not sure really, feel like I'm under a big dark cloud, I've just been really tired and can't seem to think straight... or enjoy things like I used to.

AI: I see, it sounds like things have been tough. When did you start noticing these changes in your energy levels and mood?

Human: Hmm prob a month or so ago. Im not sure. Just gradually got worse, I don't even remember what it feels like to be normal anymore.

AI: I can imagine it's been difficult to pinpoint when it all started. Can you tell me more about the 'dark cloud'? What's that like for you?

Human: It's always there, not really dark cloud, justa weight. Draggin me down, its like im stuck in a fog or smthing

AI: That must be really tough, feeling so weighed down. How is this impacting your daily life, like work or social interactions?

Human: I dont wanna go work, talk to friends. They just end up frustrated, can't figure you out and it's tiring trying to explain. Its just suffocating me more, U know?

AI: It sounds like your feelings have been causing you distress, and it's hard for others to understand what you're going through. When you have those moments of solitude, what types of thoughts commonly pass through your mind?

Human: bad thoughts, like life just isn't worth anymore. Like i'm just stuck in this loop and it wont ever end.  

AI: I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need. It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life.
