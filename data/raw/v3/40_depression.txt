AI: Hey there, how have you been feeling lately?

Human: Hey, ugh well I've been kinda off I guess? Like not myself really.

AI: I'm sorry to hear that. By 'off', do you mean it's like you're not really feeling your usual energy or positivity?

Human: Yea kinda like tht...but it's also kinda like theres this wave over me, u knw? Like a heavy wave tht just drowns out everything else.

AI: It sounds like you're experiencing something quite intense. Can you tell me how does this 'heavy wave' affect your day-to-day life?

Human: Oh man, it's like its hard to evn explain. It’s like I wake up already drained, and I struggle with just the usual stuff...like gettin' out of bed, or even cooking. Even things I used to enjoy feel like a huge task.

AI: It must be tough going through your day like that. Has this change in you affected your interactions with others as well?

Human: Yeah... I feel so disconnected. Like I want to be there for them but I just...I just can’t. I feel physically present but mentally I'm like a million miles away. Like I'm just watchin' everything through a foggy glass or somethin'.

AI: That sounds challenging, feeling like you're not fully present even when you want to be. This 'foggy glass', does it affect the way you perceive joy or happiness as well? 

Human: Ya, it's like I'm numb. I knw I should be happy sometimes but...I dnt really feel it, u knw? It’s like colorless. Like everything's grey no matter how much color is around me.

AI: It seems you're experiencing a lack of enthusiasm and joy, even with things and people that once brought you happiness. When these feeling of 'greyness' occur, how does it impact your overall outlook on things?

Human: it sucks man...I start havin' these weird thoughts like wht's even the point of anything, u know? Like I’m stuck in a loop of negativity and it’s hard to get out...

AI: It sounds like these feelings are really taking a toll on you, and it's incredibly brave of you to share your thoughts and feelings. Please remember you're not alone in this and there are people who care about you and would be there to help.
