Human: Oh it's like. uh ..in my hip? Lower side rather. Around a 7 or so?

AI: I can understand that must be quite uncomfortable. Can you tell me more about the nature of the pain? For example, is it a sharp, stabbing pain or more of a dull, achy sensation?

Human: No not sharp... it's more like a nagging dull ache. Gets worse when I've bin sitting or standing for long... or when it's cold.
