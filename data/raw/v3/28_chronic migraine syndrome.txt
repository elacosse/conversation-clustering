AI: Hi there, I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time. I was wondering, could you share any recurring discomfort, pain or major inconvenience you experience in your day-to-day life?

Human: Hey, umm yeah so I deal with these headacheos...like really bad ones and quite often. They just come out of nowhere.. don't have to be stressed or anything. There just there and they're bad.

AI: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you perhaps describe what these headaches feel like? And are there any specific pattern to their occurrence?

Human: Its hard to explain.. they start out like a normal headache, but then the pain just intensifies. Almost like a hammer bashing into my skull.. The light hurts.. sound hurts. Most time.. every day. Light feels brighter, sound feels louder just before they come...

AI: That sounds really difficult to manage. I can imagine some days might be extremely hard to concentrate or carry out tasks. How do these headaches affect your daily routine or plans?

Human: Yeah u could say that. Often got to stop whatever Im doing and lie down. Lights off, no noise.. Sometimes even that dosn't work... ruins meetings, outings, even simple stuff like cooking or watching tv.

AI: It’s tough when something like this has such disruptive effects. Do any external factors make these episodes worse? And how do you cope with the pain when it happens?

Human: Haven't really noticed anything making it worse except maybe stress sometimes. Coping is hard... try to sleep it off when I can. Meds don't work unless its really strong one. Just got to go throught it... these "episodes" as you say, last way longer than you'd think. It’s not like normal headache pain either...

AI: Yes, I can understand how it's so much more than just a "normal" headache. Apart from medication and sleep, are there any other ways or little things that you have found that might ease the discomfort or manage it even slightly?

Human: Not really, it's isolating if anything... chill, darkness, quiet are best, people don’t get it, think it's just a headache but it's so much more. Its ruling my life..
