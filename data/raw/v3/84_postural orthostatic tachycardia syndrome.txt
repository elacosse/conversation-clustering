AI: Hi! How has your day been? 

Human: Hey, pretty meh. Feeling tired and kinda out of whack but that's normal. 

AI: I'm sorry to hear that. Could you explain a bit more? How does "out of it" manifest for you?

Human: It's like every time i get up, my heart goes all fast & fluttery. Can't stand in lines or anything. And, tired like ALL the time, lol.

AI: It sounds pretty taxing. This rapid heartbeat, how long does it persist when you stand up?

Human: Dunno exactly...prob. few mins. Sometimes if stand too long, faints happen. But i mean, I kinda get used to it.

AI: That seems like a difficult adjustment. This fatigue you mentioned, is it different from just being tired?

Human: Well I guess. It's like I'm drained, even after a good nightâ€™s sleep. Coffee doesn't work anymore.

AI: That must be very challenging. Does anything help? 

Human: I guess lying dow helps sometimes. oh and salty snacks. Doc told me to up da salt for some reason. 

AI: Interesting, how does upping the salt intake affect you?

Human: I suppose it helps a bit...feels like it gives a bit of energy maybe? hard to tell honestly...

AI: Understandable. These impacts...how do they affect your everyday life or your interactions with others?

Human: Pretty rough tbh. Hard to keep up with everyone else...feeling like you're 80 when you're only 20, lol. It's hard for people to get it tho.

AI: I can only imagine how tough that might be. What do you wish others knew about your experiences?

Human: Just to car abt how much this drains me, not to push so hard. Or at least, to not get upset when I can't keep up. 

AI: That sounds like it would be really helpful. It's important for people to respect your boundaries. Thanks for sharing your experience with me.
