AI: Hi there, I understand that you've been experiencing some discomfort lately. Can you tell me a bit more about what you've been feeling?

Human: hey yeah.. So it's bt weird. U knw like ws feeling absolutely fine n suddenly feel dizzy.. light headnes.. nw it often happens wen I stand up

AI: Thanks for sharing. Seems like you often experience dizziness upon standing. How does this make you feel when it happens? Could you describe it a bit more? 

Human: Its like..... I am on a fast swing you know. Gets really hard, heart starts beating too fast. Light headed too. kinda hard to explain...
   
AI: Sounds like a challenging sensation. You mentioned your heart feels like it's beating too fast when this happens, can you tell me more about that? Also, does this feeling persist for long or does it eventually settle?

Human: yeah.. the heart thing is scary... beets lyk super fast.. not normal.. And it's a bit difficult coz it often lasts a while before I feel normal. I have to sit down or lie down sometimes too

AI: Understandable, it sounds quite distressing to deal with. How does this affect your day-to-day activities? 

Human: it really sucks you know, I was so active. Loved hiking, but now I even have trouble doing normal stuff like grocery shopping, it's all too exhausting. Sometimes, in the middle of nowhere, I just have to stop and sit cause of the dizziness. I miss my active life... 

AI: That must be really tough. Adjusting from an active lifestyle to one where even daily activities seem hard. Do you get any sort of relief or do certain things alleviate your symptoms? Thank you for sharing all this with me.

Human: It's a bit comforting I guess when I lie down ... U know it kindof helps bringing the heartbeat down. I've also started intaking a lot of salt... strangely, it seems to help a bit. But still, it's very hard... I just want things to go back to normal you know 

AI: It sounds really difficult. Thank you for being open about your experiences. Would you like to share more about how this has affected your emotional well-being or mental health?
