AI: Hello! I hope you're having a good day. I understand that you've been experiencing some unusual symptoms lately. Could you explain more about what you're feeling?

Human: Oh hi there. Yeah, well, it's a bit hard to describe. lt's like everytime I get up frm a chair or even from bed, it's like my heart starts racing as if run marathon you know?

AI: I see, when did you start noticing this kind of experience? Is it just the racing heart, or do you feel other symptoms too?

Human: I guess it was fee months ago now, not quite sure but it's bothersome. It's more thn just racing heart. Sometimes get dizzy too after standing up, you know light headed. 

AI: That does sound difficult to manage, I can imagine it would be quite disruptive to your daily life. How are these experiences affecting things like work or your personal activities?

Human: It's quite a mess I must say. Can't even keep my job properly. Afraid to move around too much. Don't want to pass out in the middle of something. Living with constant fear is just draining. 

AI: It must be tough for you to manage not just the physical symptoms but the anxiety and fear as well. Have you sought any medical help or tried any treatments to alleviate the symptoms?

Human: I've been to doctors, a lot of tests done but they can't seem to figure out whats wrong. Tried some meds too but didnt help much. This has become my part of life I guess. 

AI: It must be frustrating not having definitive answers yet. It's okay to feel upset about this. In your daily routine, are there any modifications that you have made to adapt to these changes? 

Human: Yeah, I try to avoid sudden movements, get up slowly, try to rest in between. But that's not life you know, constantly being careful and living in fear.

AI: Yes, it seems like a significant change to your lifestyle, which can feel very constraining. How about your emotional and mental wellbeingâ€”how are you managing those aspects? 

Human: It's hard for sure. Some days worse than the others, but trying to stay positive. Not easy though!! Its hard, u know nobody truly understands what this feels like. I just hope for a normal day without these crazy symptoms.
