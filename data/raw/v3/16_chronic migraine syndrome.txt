Human: Hi. well, its like this constant aching, you know. Almost everyday. Sort of a strong tightness in my head. just never lets up

AI: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more details? How long has this been an episode? 

Human: :augh almost too long. atleast a few years now

AI: That sounds challenging to deal with. And how would you compare this feeling to anything else? Is it like anything you've experienced before?

Human: Nothing compared to ths really. jst whole nother level. Think like worst hangover ever but doesn't stop. And bright lights, noise seem to make it worse. Struggle to focus on anything, can't be productive. Eyes blur at times too

AI: Sounds exhausting. I'm really sorry you're going through this. Do these sensations shift or change depending on the time of the day?

Human: It seems to b worse durin the day but no wholesale change. Some days it lightens up a bit but never fully goes away. 

AI: That must be quite challenging. Can you tell me how it affects your daily routine? 

Human: i lost my job... led to too much time off. hard to even do basic things, groceries, cleaning. Hard to even take car of my kids.

Human: Im frustrated, sometimes mad... why me?, you knw? ive got to b the one who fighs not just t work, or for the family. But also to just ... exist. With this thing in my head.
